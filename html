            Bangladesh is part of the historic and ethnolinguistic region of Bengal, which was divided during the
            Partition of
            British India in 1947 as the eastern enclave of the Dominion of Pakistan, from which it gained independence
            in 1971
            after a bloody war

        <p id="i5">
            Bangladesh shares land borders with India to the north, west, and east, and Myanmar to the southeast. To the
            south, it
